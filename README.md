# War

This is my take on the classic card game of War! A standard deck of 52 cards will be shuffled and evenly distributed to both sides. The player can flip a card from each deck and then compare them to see who has the higher card (remember, aces are high). Whichever deck had the better card gets to keep both cards played. If the value of the cards are equal, a war starts. In a war scenario, both decks flip another card, and those two are then compared, with the winner taking all. If the value of the cards are equal again, a second war starts. A second war scenario is the same as a regular war, but if the cards are equal again, it's deemed a draw, and all cards are returned to their original deck. The game is won when either deck runs out of cards.

I've styled the game with a western theme to give the feeling of playing cards in a saloon.
